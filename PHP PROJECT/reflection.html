         This project had many challenges that I needed to overcome. Anytime I am dealing with HTML and CSS, getting the page layout to look like the desired outcome is a challenge.
         With this project, I created an image on every page.  That made the page look nice, but it created issues with making things such as tables and forms to be visible and easy to read. 
         I could have chosen to not have the image on the entire page, which would have made it easier to make forms and tables more visible but when I tried this,
         I didn’t feel it was as nice looking as with the images covering the whole page.  Keeping that layout required me to change the contrast between the forms and the background. 
         I made the background lighter in certain areas and made the form and table appear clear. I accomplished this by using linear gradient colors for the background image and blur backdrop filters.
         After I got the CSS correct on the general template of all the pages I then moved onto the connection with the database.  
         Connecting to the AMPPS database was not hard and worked as expected but I ran into issues when moving the page to the domain database.
         The connection did not work the same. The system appeared to establish a connection, but it would not populate any of the information as it did with AMPPS. 
         This meant that none of the queries, tables, and forms would work like I wanted them to.  After trying to get this to work for the past several weeks with no success,
         had to give up on the domain and focus mostly just on making it work with AMPPS, although I will continue after this class and will overcome the issues. 
         After establishing connections with the AMPPS, the next challenge is changing the standard select statements from SQL into prepared statements. 
         There were quite a few of these that I found not working the same way as the normal SQL statement. 
         The server acted as if it didn’t always want to work the same way as it did with the standard SQL statements. 
         For example, with some of the for loops I had I had to modify them to make them produce the same results.
         The next issue I ran into was working with AJAX. I noticed at times with AJAX it would pull the data from the JSON file but would not update after the original file was shown on the screen. 
         I then figured out that if I cleared the cache and cookies, it would restart the system and work as intended. After researching this I have found this to be a common thing with many developers and maybe one downside to using AJAX. 
         I also struggled with just the basic understanding of what the assignment was asking for. I thought this may be a situation where it was just me and others may not have the same reactions as I did but after having others review,
         they agreed with me. There were not enough details to understand exactly what was needed with the requirements.  I often would have to write the code multiple times because I would write out what I believed the assignment was wanting 
         and after talking to the instructor was going in the completely wrong direction. I believe the assignment needs to be changed to be more specific and detailed on the requirements,
         giving more examples and steps to the desired completion. It's quite hard to complete an assignment and get the desired results if you don’t fully understand what the intended audience is looking for. This is very true in development as well. 
         Often software is written to what is believed to be the expected requirements and needs to be rewritten after the initial review. 
         If I was going to do this project again I would do it completely differently. 
         I would spend a lot more time in the planning stages, with every aspect of the program. 
         I would sit down with the instructor and get as many details as possible on what direction the project will be going and plan out accordingly.
         There were quite a few times when I would have written out the software for this project and then the next week's requirements would come into view and it wouldn’t fit with what I was trying to accomplish, so I would have to change and modify.
         It would be much easier doing that in the planning stages, rather than after the code was written. But when we don’t know the following week's requirements ahead of time, that isn’t possible.  I would also modify much of my code to make it more efficient. 
         The more I learned throughout the class the more my thoughts on my original approach and design changed. The problem with the time constraints of the class limits the amount of time we must change things up.  One example of this would be using session variables. 
         At the beginning of class, I struggled to understand the capabilities of these types of variables. Although there were examples of these types of variables, I didn’t fully understand how you can pass these variables from page to page. I would take advantage of them for future development projects. 
         I also really started to like PHP, MYSQL, JSON, and AJAX. Before this course, I had very little experience with PHP, JSON, and AJAX. I have had a bunch of SQL in general with work but it was nice to have ways to combine SQL with other languages and make use of them rather than my typical job of just querying a database and creating advanced reports. 
         I overall like this class and learning new languages and how server-side web development works. This type of development is one area that I would like to do in my future job roles. I find it very interesting and fun because it allows me to be creative on both the algorithms side of things but also the style and creativity that CSS brings to the software.
